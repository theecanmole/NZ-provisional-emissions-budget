## Explaining the emissions budget it's the bodge that gives the number of emissions units to auction in the emissions trading scheme

I feel I need to do a deep dive into emissions budgets.

<i>The emissions budget is the bodge that papers over all the cracks and flaws in the [emissions trading scheme](https://genless.govt.nz/climate-change/the-emissions-trading-scheme-explained/) and gives  the number emissions units to auction into the carbon market.</i>

Specifically emissions budgets are a tool to [calculate the number of emissions units](https://environment.govt.nz/what-government-is-doing/areas-of-work/climate-change/ets/nz-ets-market/setting-unit-limits-in-the-nz-ets/#calculating-nzus-available-at-nz-ets-auctions) that will be auctioned to emitters under the [New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme](https://environment.govt.nz/what-government-is-doing/areas-of-work/climate-change/ets/).

The Ministry for the Environment's web site has an explanation of how the [emissions budgets help calculate](https://environment.govt.nz/what-government-is-doing/areas-of-work/climate-change/ets/nz-ets-market/setting-unit-limits-in-the-nz-ets/#the-number-of-nzus-available-for-auction-over-2021-2027) the amount of units to auction into the [emissions trading scheme](https://genless.govt.nz/climate-change/the-emissions-trading-scheme-explained/) each quarter.

The Ministry for the Environment's web site features this chart showing the components of the emissions budget.</p>

The web page then shows this table of the annual auction volumes.

Specifically, the emissions budget is the 2020 provisional emissions budget for the years 2021 to 2025. This comes from a [Q and A document](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2020-06/NZETS%20Q%26A.pdf) attached to a Government media release dated 2 June 2020 [Emission trading reforms another step to meeting climate targets](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/emission-trading-reforms-another-step-meeting-climate-targets) by James Shaw Minister for Climate Change Issues.

These five year emissions budgets roll forward as each year passes. So the current emissions budget is 2023 to 2027.

What is the point of the five year emissions budget?

It is to drag down the trend line in New Zealand's gross and net emissions of greenhouse gases. This is helpfully shown by this chart from the Climate Change Commission's advice to the Government. We can see the three jaffa and blue coloured bars representing the three five year budgets 1, 2 and 3 sequentially reducing and pulling down the trend line of emissions.
